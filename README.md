## 💻 Java Practice – From "Hello World" to "Wait, What?" 
Officially my first GitHub repository, featuring all the little programs I wrote during my first summer of coding (as a curious noob). <br> 
This repo is a collection of everything I practiced, explored, and experimented with over the break — from basic syntax drills to small challenges and mini-projects.

## 🧪Why This Repo? 
I believe in learning by doing, and this repository was my way of:
- **Exploring** new technologies
- **Practicing** problem-solving
- **Building** a daily coding routine
- **Documenting** progress throughout the summer

## 📌What's Inside? 
This repo is organized into folders based on topics, languages, or concepts.Here’s a general idea of what you might find: 
🔹 **Java Programs** – Practice problems and core programming exercises. 

🔹 **Mini Projects** – Small but meaningful projects to reinforce learning. 

🔹 **Miscellaneous** – Random experiments, notes, or code snippets 

*Note: Each folder may contain its own README with more specific details.* 

## 🛠️Tech Stack and Tools 
**Language:** Java<br> 
**Tools:** VS Code, Git , Github<br> 
**Concepts:** Basics, DSA ,OOP

## 📅Timeline 
**Start Date:** 17th August 2025<br> 
**End Date:** Ongoing 

## 🤝Contribution and Feedback 
This is a personal learning space, but feedback is always welcome! If you spot something that can be improved or want to share ideas, feel free to open an issue or reach out.

*Either way — thanks for stopping by!* 😄<br>
*Now go write some code... or take a nap. Both are productive.*
